-   Slots used in the Pattern Grid for pattern encoding and Crafting Grid crafting matrix slots now display an orange backdrop and tooltip to indicate whether the item is autocraftable at a glance. This checks patterns from your network and from your inventory.
-   Added help tooltip for filtering based on recipe items in the Crafting Grid.
-   The crafting amount and crafting preview screens have been merged. Changing the amount will update the live preview.

    through as-is to the output side, but you can choose to pass the energy buffer, security settings or (specific)
    storage resources of the input network to the output network.
-   When using the Relay when "pass-through" mode is off, and when passing all storage resources or specific storage

-   To not lock the entire network by default for players who do not have a matching Security Card, a Fallback Security
    Card can be used to configure this behavior.
